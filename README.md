# DropNet
Please find the codes for "DropNet: An Improved Dropping Algorithm Based on Neural Networks for Line-of-Sight Massive MIMO".
The paper is open access, available at https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9357421

- Run "Fig_3.m" to get Figure 3 of the paper.
- To get Figure 4 to Figure 6 of the paper: <br />
    a) Run "Train_xx.m" (xx is "CB" or "ZF") <br />
        - You need to put the generated mat files for Python code in an appropriate folder for step b <br />
            - Example --> put the generated mat files on '/9a_4u_MRT_Shadowing/' Fig. 4. (a) <br />
    b) Run python code (the link will be added by tomorrow, march 30th, 2021)<br />
        - After running the Python code, you need to put the generated mat files in an appropriate folder for step c<br />
            - Example --> put the generated mat files on '/9a_4u_MRT_Shadowing/' for the scenario of Fig. 4. (a) <br />
    c) Run "Predict_xx.m" (xx is "CB" or "ZF")<br />
    
    
Let me know if you have any questions or if I can be of any help : )<br />
