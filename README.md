# DropNet
Please find the codes for "DropNet: An Improved Dropping Algorithm Based on Neural Networks for Line-of-Sight Massive MIMO".
The paper is open access, available at https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9357421

- Run "Fig_3.m" to get Figure 3 of the paper.
- To get Figure 4 to Figure 6 of the paper:
    a) Run "Fig_4_Train_xx.m" (xx is "MRT" or "ZF")
    b) Run "Python_Train_NN.ipyb" (Train the NN via Python)
    c) Run "Fig_4_Predic_xx.m" (xx is "MRT" or "ZF")
    
    
Let me know if you have any questions or if I can be of any help : )
