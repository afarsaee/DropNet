# DropNet
Please find the codes for "DropNet: An Improved Dropping Algorithm Based on Neural Networks for Line-of-Sight Massive MIMO".
The paper is open access, available at https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9357421

- Run "Fig_3.m" to get Figure 3 of the paper.
- To get Figure 4 to Figure 6 of the paper:
    a) Run "Train_xx.m" (xx is "CB" or "ZF") 
        --> You need to put the generated mat files from Python in an appropriate folder for step b
            --> Example --> put the generated mat files on '/CB_final_results/9x4_Shadowing/' Fig. 4. (a)
    b) Run python code
    c) Run "Predict_xx.m" (xx is "CB" or "ZF")
    
    
Let me know if you have any questions or if I can be of any help : )
